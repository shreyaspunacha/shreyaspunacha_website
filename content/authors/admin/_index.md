I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the University of Washington, Seattle. My research focuses on the intricate relationship between the cortical and biomechanical changes during the oromotor behaviour and their implications in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementias.

In our laboratory, we use chronically implanted microelectrode arrays to capture the cortical activity in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex while simultaneously tracking the precise movements of the tongue and the jaw in three dimensions using a biplanar video-radiography setup. These observations are made during the natural feeding behaviour of both the young and old macaques, providing valuable insight into the complex mechanisms at play.

My academic background is rooted in Physics, with a specialization in computational biology. I hold a PhD from the Physics department at National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal in India. My doctoral research was focused on the dynamics and control of spiral waves that cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias using low voltage electric fields. I have also explored pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and tackled computational problems in Blackhole Thermodynamics and Fluid Gravity.

I have excellent knowledge of programming with Matlab, Python and C on cluster architectures. For my research, I have designed algorithms and developed parallel programs using Message Passing Interface for various ionic and electrophysiological cardiac models in two and three dimensions. I have experience working with experimentalists on imaging, analysis and building computational models to validate their results. Besides my research, I have mentored several masters students and worked as a teaching assistant for several courses during my PhD.
