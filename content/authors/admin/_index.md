I am a Physicist and Computational Biologist at the Department of Oral Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle. My current interests include studying the neural activity of the cerebral cortex along with the tongue and mandible movements to understand the principles of sensorimotor control.

Previously, I was at Shajahan Lab, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India. My doctoral dissertation studies the dynamics of spiral waves in excitable media. The project aimed to control the spiral waves causing cardiac arrhythmias using low-voltage electric fields. I have also worked on pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and computational problems on Blackhole Thermodynamics.

I have excellent knowledge of programming with Python and C on cluster architectures. For my research, I have designed algorithms and developed parallel programs using Message Passing Interface for various ionic and electrophysiological cardiac models in two and three dimensions. I have experience working with experimentalists on imaging, analysis and building computational models to validate their results.

Besides my research, I have mentored several Masters's students and worked as a teaching assistant for several courses during my PhD. I believe in knowledge sharing and contribute by sharing my code, tutorials and lecture notes.
