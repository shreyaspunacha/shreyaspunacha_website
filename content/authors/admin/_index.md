I am a Physics PhD from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal. My doctoral dissertation is a study on the dynamics of spiral waves in excitable media. The vision of my research is to understand cardiac dynamics and to control the spiral waves causing cardiac arrhythmias using low voltage electric fields.
I have also worked on pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and computational problems on Blackhole Thermodynamics.

I have excellent knowledge of programming with Python and C on cluster architectures. For my research, I have designed algorithms and developed parallel programs using message passing interface for various ionic and electrophysiological cardiac models in two and three dimensions. I have experience working with experimentalists on imaging, analysis and building computational models to validate their results.

Besides my research, I have mentored several masters students and have worked as a teaching assistant for several courses during the course of my PhD. I believe in knowledge sharing, and I try to contribute by sharing my code, tutorials and lecture notes.
