# Excitable Medium: From Wildfires To Cardiac Arrhythmias

Every year wildfires consume thousand of hectares of forests across the world causing great deal
of devastation to the wildlife and human kind. As the climate change is increasing the frequency of
the wildfires around the planet, scientists are looking for ways to better predict and control them. The problem they are dealing with is surprisingly similar to the electrical signals that cause arrhythmias in the heart. So, what connects these raging wildfires across the world to the electrical signals in the heart?

The connection between the forest fire-front and the electrical signals that wreck havoc in the heart becomes apparent when we look at the mathematics of their wave propagation. Mathematically, both the medium are classified as an excitable medium and these waves are called excitation waves. 

Excitable media is made up of large number of elements (or cells) distributed in space, each element of which possesses the property of excitability. The elements of the excitable medium intract with each other through diffusion-like coupling. The general properties of an excitable element are the following:

1. Each element has a stable resting state. We can compare this condition to a fully grown and thriving forest.
2. The cell has an excitation threshold. The cell can only be activated if the stimulus is above this threshold. For example, a small spark at some corner of the forest may not be able to sustain a fire. A certain amount of inital fire is required to start and sustain the fire. 
3. Each cell has a property of refractoriness. The cell takes a certain amount of time to be ready for a second stimulus following the first excitation. During this time interval, another stimulus, no matter how strong, will not be able to generate a second acrivation. This time interval is called the refractory period of the cell. 

Once the forest is totally burned down, the fire cannot sustain as there is no fuel left to burn. To start a new fire, we have to wait till the forest re-grows. The time taken to regrow the forest corresponds to the refractory period of the forest. Because excitable media take time to recover after a wave passes, two waves in such a system would annihilate each other instead of passing through each other like sound waves or water waves.

In case of the forest fire, the refractory period can last for several months or even years. However, in certain biological and chemical medium, the refractory period lasts only a few hundreds of milli seconds. Because of the short refractory period,  they are able to exhibit complex pattern formation like rotating spiral waves. Examples of spiral waves in other forms of excitable medium are shown in the figures below.

Fig (a) shows the spiral waves in a oscillating chemical medium called Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Fig (b) shows the simulated spiral wave in a rabbit heart. Fig (c) shows multiple spiral waves in a starving colony of amoeba called Dictostellium Discodium. Fib (d) is a harmless condition called Geographic tongue where spiral waves form on the human tongue. 

## Cardiac Arrhythmia

A heart muscle is made up of cells that contract and relax according to the electrical signals sent out by the natural pacemaker cells called Siano-Atrial node. As the waves emitted by the SA node spreads arcoss the muscle, the heart beats and facilitates the blood circulation throught the body. A normal heart would beat about 60-100 times per minute. 

Under certain conditions, the abnormalities in the heart can alter the shape of the waves emitted by the Siano-Atrial node and give rise to spiral waves. Since a spiral wave rotates with a much higher frequency and propagates differently from the normal pacemaker signal, it will result in the disruption of the normal blood pumping ability of the heart. This condition is called cardiac arrhythmia. 

Therefore, a better understanding of the dynamics of spiral waves may lead to safer and less invasive ways to treat different forms of arrhythmias. There are several methods of treating arrhythmias such as drug therapy and defibrillation. We shall discuss these methods in detail in the future posts.
