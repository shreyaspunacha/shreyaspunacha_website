    "Suppose we have a square shaped iron plate and we know how the heat is distributed across the plate at a certain point in time. What we are curious in is the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "How will the heat distribution change over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the heat tends to flow from the warmer region to the colder region. Therefore, what we are trying to find is an equation that describes this process. The phenomenon of heat flow can be modelled by a partial differential equation called heat equation. The application of this equation is quite diverse. It is used by both engineers and physicists to describe processes like heat flow, molecular diffusion, Brownian motion etc.  "

Explicit means the solution at a given time step depends only on the previous time step which is in contrast to the implicit method where the solution also depends on the subsequent time step. Finite difference method provides an approximate numerical solution to the problem by descritising the domain into grids. The temperature $u(x,y,t)$ is sought on each node of the grid.\n",

    "The heat equation is of fundamental importance across scientific fields. The more general version of the heat equation called diffusion equation is used extensively in physical and biological sciences. In physics and statistics, the heat equation is related with the study of Brownian motion via Fokker-Planck equaiton. In this post we saw how the heat equation can be discritised into set of algebraic equaitons on a mesh grid. In the next post we solve these algebraic equations using Python programming language. "
